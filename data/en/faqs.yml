    - title : Clear overview
      content : In Yester you set the order of tasks to be performed and have a clear understanding of who is responsible for each task. Everyone has an overview of who has to perform the current task and what needs to be done to move forward.

    - title : Reduces waste / More efficient processes
      content : Processes will be faster as the path has been set and everyone knows what to do and when. There will be no wondering who is currently responsible or whether the task has already been completed.

    - title : Improved information flow
      content : Receiving client feedback requires immediate attention. With Yester, everyone who needs to be involved will receive a notification with an overview of the matter in hand. No chain emails, duplicated problem solving or forgetting to react.
      
    - title : Easy to customize and develop further
      content : Yester allows you to react to your current needs by simply developing your workflow. For example, if the purchase manager needs to be involved in a client feedback process, the change can be made quickly and seamlessly. Or if your company decides to reduce approvals of a vacation process - itâ€™s just a quick change and can be done without weeks of development.
